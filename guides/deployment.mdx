## Deploy to Sunpeak

The easiest way to deploy your widget is using the Sunpeak CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Sunpeak">
    Authenticate with your Sunpeak account:

    ```bash
    sunpeak login
    ```

    This opens your browser for authentication. You only need to do this once.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and deploy">
    Build your widget and deploy to production:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm build
        sunpeak deploy
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run build
        sunpeak deploy
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn build
        sunpeak deploy
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    The `deploy` command pushes your built resources with the `prod` tag,
    so that they can be easily pulled and served by your production MCP server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Add a release script to your `package.json` for one-command deploys:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "sunpeak build && sunpeak deploy"
  }
}
```
</Tip>

### Version Management

Use tags to manage different versions of your resources:

```bash
# Push and tag all resources as staging
sunpeak push --tag staging

# Push and tag all resources as version 1.2.0
sunpeak push --tag v1.2.0

# Push with multiple tags
sunpeak push --tag v1.2.0 --tag latest

# Push a single resource
sunpeak push dist/search.js --tag v1.2.0
```

<Info>
Resource names must be unique within a repository. URIs are assigned automatically by Sunpeak when you push—you'll see them when you pull resources back.
</Info>

## Manual Deployment

Alternatively, you can deploy your widget manually to any static hosting service
or directly into your production MCP server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your widget for production">
    Create an optimized production build:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm build
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn build
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This creates:
    - Minified and optimized JavaScript.
    - CSS with unused styles removed.
    - Static assets with hashed filenames.
    - Source maps for debugging.

    Output directory: `dist/`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your widget UI">
    Deploy the built widget to any static hosting service:

    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card horizontal title="Vercel" icon="triangle">
        Zero-config static hosting
      </Card>
      <Card horizontal title="Netlify" icon="diamond">
        Simple drag-and-drop deployment
      </Card>
      <Card horizontal title="Cloudflare Pages" icon="cloud">
        Fast global CDN
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    Upload the `dist/` directory to your chosen platform. You'll get a public URL like:
    ```
    https://your-widget.vercel.app
    ```

    <Info>
    The MCP server (`pnpm mcp`) is a **development server for local testing only**. Do not use it in production.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a production MCP server">
    Create your own production MCP server that references your deployed UI as a resource.

    Your MCP server should:
    - Define the tools your widget needs.
    - Return your widget UI URL as an MCP resource when tools are invoked.
    - Handle any backend logic or API calls.

    Example MCP server configuration:

    ```typescript
    // Your production MCP server
    const server = createMCPServer({
      tools: [
        {
          name: 'show-my-widget',
          description: 'Display my custom widget',
          handler: async () => {
            return {
              resource: {
                url: 'https://your-widget.vercel.app',
                type: 'ui'
              }
            };
          }
        }
      ]
    });
    ```

    Deploy this MCP server to a Node.js hosting service (Vercel, Railway, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure ChatGPT">
    Connect your production MCP server to ChatGPT:

    1. Open ChatGPT in developer mode.
    2. Navigate to `User > Settings > Apps & Connectors > Create`.
    3. Enter your MCP server URL with the `/mcp` path:
       ```
       https://your-mcp-server.vercel.app/mcp
       ```
    4. Test by sending `show my widget` (or whatever you set as the name of your tool) to ChatGPT.
  </Step>
