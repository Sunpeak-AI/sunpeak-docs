## Overview

The sunpeak Starter Kit includes pre-built React components in your project's `src/components/` directory. These components are built on [@openai/apps-sdk-ui](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui) and follow ChatGPT's design guidelines.

## Resources

Resources (from MCP) are top-level components that can be simulated or shipped to production.

Resources are kept in the `src/components/resources/` directory.
Every file in this directory ending with `-resource.tsx` will be built by `pnpm build` to
`dist/chatgpt/name.js`, where the output name will be whatever was prefixed to `-resource.tsx`.

## High-Level Components

sunpeak comes with some pre-packaged high level components built out of the low-level components
described below.

- **[Albums](/api-reference/components/albums)** - A photo album viewer with carousel display and fullscreen viewing capability.
- **[Card](/api-reference/components/card)** - A versatile card for displaying rich content with images, headers, metadata, and action buttons.
- **[Carousel](/api-reference/components/carousel)** - A horizontal scrolling carousel for displaying multiple cards with navigation arrows and smooth transitions.

### Customization

These components are included in your project source code, so you can modify them to fit your needs:

- **Edit directly**: Components are in `src/components/`.
- **Add variants**: Extend with new props or styles.
- **Create new components**: Use these as templates.

### Design Principles

All components follow (and are required to follow) ChatGPT's design guidelines:

  Automatic light/dark theme adaptation.
</Card>

<Card horizontal title="Responsive" icon="mobile">
  Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
</Card>

<Card horizontal title="Accessible" icon="universal-access">
  WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.
</Card>

<Card horizontal title="Simple" icon="check">
   UI reduced to the absolute minimum to support the context.
</Card>

## Low-Level Components

Beyond the Starter Kit components, you can use any component from `@openai/apps-sdk-ui`:

```tsx
import { Button, Input, Select } from '@openai/apps-sdk-ui/components';
```

See the [OpenAI apps-sdk-ui documentation](https://openai.github.io/apps-sdk-ui/) for the full low-level component library.
