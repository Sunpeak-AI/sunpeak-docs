## Overview

The sunpeak framework includes pre-built MCP resources in your project's `src/resources/` directory. Each resource lives in its own folder with its component, metadata, simulations, and related components.

These components are built on [@openai/apps-sdk-ui](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui)
and follow ChatGPT's design guidelines.

## Resources

Resources (from MCP) are top-level components that can be simulated or shipped to production.

Each resource lives in its own folder under `src/resources/{name}/`:
- `{name}-resource.tsx` - The React component (built to `dist/{name}/{name}.js`)
- `{name}-resource.json` - Metadata (name, title, description, etc.)
- `{name}-{scenario}-simulation.json` - Test scenarios
- `components/` - Optional resource-specific components

See the [Resource Library API Reference](/api-reference/resources/albums) for
all pre-packaged sunpeak resources.

## High-Level Components

Sunpeak resources are built out of higher-level components that live alongside each resource in `src/resources/{name}/components/`.

### Customization

These components are included in your project source code, so you can modify them to fit your needs:

- **Edit directly**: Components are in each resource's `components/` folder.
- **Add variants**: Extend with new props or styles.
- **Create new components**: Use these as templates.

### Design Principles

All components follow (and are required to follow) ChatGPT's design guidelines:

## Low-Level Components

Beyond the framework components, you can use any component from `@openai/apps-sdk-ui`:

```tsx
import { Button, Input, Select } from '@openai/apps-sdk-ui/components';
```

See the [OpenAI apps-sdk-ui documentation](https://openai.github.io/apps-sdk-ui/) for the full low-level component library.
