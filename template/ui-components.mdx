## Overview

The sunpeak Starter Kit includes pre-built React components in your project's `src/components/` directory. These components are built on [openai/apps-sdk-ui](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui) and follow ChatGPT's design guidelines.

## Top-Level Components

- **[Card](/api-reference/components/card)** - A versatile card component for displaying rich content with images, headers, metadata, and action buttons.
- **[Carousel](/api-reference/components/carousel)** - A horizontal scrolling carousel for displaying multiple cards with navigation arrows and smooth transitions.

## Quick Example

<QuickstartExample file="quickstart-example.mdx" />

## Customization

These components are included in your project source code, so you can modify them to fit your needs:

- **Edit directly**: Components are in `src/components/`
- **Add variants**: Extend with new props or styles
- **Create new components**: Use these as templates

## Design Principles

All components follow (and are required to follow) ChatGPT's design guidelines:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Theme Support" icon="palette">
    Automatic light/dark theme adaptation
  </Card>

  <Card title="Responsive" icon="mobile">
    Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
  </Card>

  <Card title="Accessible" icon="universal-access">
    WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simple" icon="check">
     Information and UI should be reduced to the absolute minimum to support the context
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Low-Level Components

Beyond the Starter Kit components, you can use any component from `@openai/apps-sdk-ui`:

```tsx
import { Button, Input, Select } from '@openai/apps-sdk-ui/components';
```

See the [OpenAI apps-sdk-ui documentation](https://openai.github.io/apps-sdk-ui/) for the full low-level component library.
