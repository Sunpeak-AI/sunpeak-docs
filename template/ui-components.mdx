## Overview

The sunpeak framework includes pre-built MCP resources consisting of React components in your project's
`src/resources/` and `src/components/` directories, respectively.

These components are built on [@openai/apps-sdk-ui](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui)
and follow ChatGPT's design guidelines.

## Resources

Resources (from MCP) are top-level components that can be simulated or shipped to production.

Resources are kept in the `src/resources/` directory.
Every file in this directory ending with `-resource.tsx` will be automatically built to
`dist/name.js`, where the output name will be whatever was prefixed to `-resource.tsx`.

See the [Resource Library API Reference](/api-reference/resources/albums) for
all pre-packaged sunpeak resources.

## High-Level Components

Sunpeak resources are built out of higher-level components in the `src/components/` directory.

### Customization

These components are included in your project source code, so you can modify them to fit your needs:

- **Edit directly**: Components are in `src/components/`.
- **Add variants**: Extend with new props or styles.
- **Create new components**: Use these as templates.

### Design Principles

All components follow (and are required to follow) ChatGPT's design guidelines:

## Low-Level Components

Beyond the framework components, you can use any component from `@openai/apps-sdk-ui`:

```tsx
import { Button, Input, Select } from '@openai/apps-sdk-ui/components';
```

See the [OpenAI apps-sdk-ui documentation](https://openai.github.io/apps-sdk-ui/) for the full low-level component library.
