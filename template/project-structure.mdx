## Overview

When you create a new project with `pnpm dlx sunpeak new`, the sunpeak Starter Kit gives you a complete project scaffold with everything needed for ChatGPT widget development.

## Key Files & Directories

- `dev/main.tsx` - ChatGPT simulator setup. Entrypoint for `sunpeak dev`.
- `mcp/server.ts` - Simple MCP server for running simulations in the real ChatGPT. Entrypoint for `sunpeak mcp`.
- `src/components/resources/` - Directory containing all your MCP Resources (ChatGPT App UIs).
    Every file in this directory ending with `-resource.tsx` will be built by `sunpeak build` to
    `dist/chatgpt/name.js`, where the output name will be whatever was prefixed to `-resource.tsx`.
- `src/simulations/` - Directory containing all your sunpeak simulations. Every simulation added to
    `SIMULATIONS` in `template/src/simulations/index.ts` will be wired into the `ChatGPTSimulator`
    and `runMCPServer`.
