## Overview

When you create a new project with `sunpeak new`, the sunpeak framework gives you a minimal, convention-based project structure with everything needed for ChatGPT widget development.

## Key Files & Directories

- `src/resources/` - Directory containing all your MCP Resources (ChatGPT App UIs).
    Every file in this directory ending with `-resource.tsx` will be automatically built by the framework to
    `dist/name.js`, where the output name will be whatever was prefixed to `-resource.tsx`.
    Each resource **must** have a companion `-resource.json` file containing metadata (name, title, description, mimeType).
- `src/simulations/` - Directory containing simulation JSON files. Files matching `*-simulation.json` are
    automatically discovered by the dev server and MCP server. Simulations are linked to resources by filename
    prefix (e.g., `albums-show-simulation.json` links to `albums-resource.tsx`).
- `public/` - Static assets (favicon, images, etc.) served directly.
- `.sunpeak/` - Internal framework bootstrap files (managed by sunpeak, don't edit).

<Note>
No entry point files needed! The framework automatically discovers your simulations and resources using conventions.

## Included Tools

The template includes minimal, essential tooling:

### Vite

Fast build tool with hot-reload (HMR) for instant development feedback. The framework owns the dev server configuration - just run `sunpeak dev`.

### Tailwind CSS 4

Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Pre-configured via Vite plugin.
Required for [@openai/apps-sdk-ui](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui), which is also configured out-of-the-box.

### TypeScript

Type safety with TypeScript 5. Configured via `tsconfig.json`.

### Vitest (Unit Tests)

Vite-native testing framework for component testing. Run with `pnpm test`.

### Add Your Own Tooling

The template is intentionally minimal. Add your preferred tools as needed:
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Type checking**: Run `tsc --noEmit` as a script
