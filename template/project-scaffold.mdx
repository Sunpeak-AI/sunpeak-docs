## Overview

When you create a new project with `pnpm dlx sunpeak new`, the sunpeak framework gives you a minimal, convention-based project structure with everything needed for ChatGPT widget development.

## Key Files & Directories

- `src/resources/` - Directory containing all your MCP Resources (ChatGPT App UIs).
    Every file in this directory ending with `-resource.tsx` will be automatically built by the framework to
    `dist/chatgpt/name.js`, where the output name will be whatever was prefixed to `-resource.tsx`.
    Each resource **must** have a companion `-resource.meta.ts` file containing server-safe metadata (name, title, description, mimeType).
    These meta files are imported by simulations and exported by the build.
- `src/simulations/` - Directory containing all your sunpeak simulations. Every simulation exported in
    `SIMULATIONS` from `src/simulations/index.ts` will be automatically discovered by the dev server and MCP server.
- `public/` - Static assets (favicon, images, etc.) served directly.
- `.sunpeak/` - Internal framework bootstrap files (managed by sunpeak, don't edit).

<Note>
No entry point files needed! The framework automatically discovers your simulations and resources using conventions.

## Available Commands

Inside your project, use these npm scripts:

<ResponseField name="pnpm dev" type="command">
  Start development server with ChatGPT simulator at `http://localhost:6767`.
  Uses Vite's hot reload for instant feedback as you edit components.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pnpm build" type="command">
  Build optimized production bundles, one for each Resource.
  Automatically discovers and builds all files matching `*-resource.tsx` in `src/resources/`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pnpm mcp" type="command">
  Start MCP server for ChatGPT testing on port 6766. Watches your `src/` directory
  and automatically rebuilds on file changes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pnpm test" type="command">
  Run unit tests with Vitest.
</ResponseField>

### Deployment Commands

<ResponseField name="sunpeak login" type="command">
  Authenticate with your Sunpeak account. Required before pushing or pulling resources.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sunpeak logout" type="command">
  Log out from Sunpeak and clear stored credentials.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sunpeak push" type="command">
  Push built resources to the Sunpeak repository. Optionally tag with `--tag`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sunpeak pull --tag <name>" type="command">
  Pull a specific version of a resource by tag from the Sunpeak repository.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sunpeak deploy" type="command">
  Deploy resources to production. Equivalent to `sunpeak push --tag prod`.
</ResponseField>

<Note>
All commands run the local `sunpeak` CLI from `node_modules/.bin` - no global install required!
You can customize tooling (linting, formatting, type-checking) by adding them to your `package.json` as needed.
</Note>

## Included Tools

The template includes minimal, essential tooling:

### Vite

Fast build tool with hot-reload (HMR) for instant development feedback. The framework owns the dev server configuration - just run `pnpm dev`.

### Tailwind CSS 4

Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Pre-configured via Vite plugin.
Required for [@openai/apps-sdk-ui](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui), which is also configured out-of-the-box.

### TypeScript

Type safety with TypeScript 5. Configured via `tsconfig.json`.

### Vitest (Unit Tests)

Vite-native testing framework for component testing. Run with `pnpm test`.

### Add Your Own Tooling

The template is intentionally minimal. Add your preferred tools as needed:
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Type checking**: Run `tsc --noEmit` as a script
