## Overview

`Albums` is a production-ready album viewer component included in the sunpeak framework. It displays photo albums in a carousel layout with the ability to open albums in fullscreen mode for detailed photo browsing. The component automatically switches between inline and fullscreen display modes.

## Import

```tsx
import { Albums } from './components/album/albums';
```

## Basic Usage

```tsx
<Albums />
```

The component retrieves album data from `useWidgetProps()` and manages selection state with `useWidgetState()`.

## Props

<ResponseField name="className" type="string">
  Additional CSS classes to apply to the albums container.
</ResponseField>

## Data Structure

### AlbumsData

The component expects data in the following format via `useWidgetProps()`:

```tsx
interface AlbumsData {
  albums: Album[]
}

interface Album {
  id: string
  title: string
  cover: string
  photos: Array<{
    id: string
    title: string
    url: string
  }>
}
```

<ResponseField name="albums" type="Album[]" required>
  Array of album objects to display.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the album.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].title" type="string" required>
  Album title displayed on the album card.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].cover" type="string" required>
  URL to the album cover image.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].photos" type="Photo[]" required>

</ResponseField>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].photos[].url" type="string" required>

## Display Modes

The Albums component has two display modes:

### Inline Mode (Default)

Displays albums in a horizontal scrolling carousel with album cards showing the cover image and photo count.

### Fullscreen Mode

When a user selects an album, the component:
1. Sets the selected album ID in widget state using `useWidgetState()`.
2. Requests fullscreen mode via `useWidgetAPI()`.
3. Displays a fullscreen photo viewer with:
   - Film strip navigation (desktop only).
   - Large centered photo display.
   - Automatic selection reset when switching albums.

## State Management

The component uses `useWidgetState` to persist the selected album across sessions:

```tsx
interface AlbumsState {
  selectedAlbumId?: string | null
}
```
