## Overview

`Albums` is a production-ready album viewer resource included in the sunpeak framework. It displays photo albums in a carousel layout with the ability to open albums in fullscreen mode for detailed photo browsing. The component automatically switches between inline and fullscreen display modes.

The resource retrieves album data from `useWidgetProps()` and manages selection state with `useWidgetState()`.

## Data Structure

### AlbumsData

The resource expects data in the following format via `useWidgetProps()`:

```tsx
interface AlbumsData {
  albums: Album[]
}

interface Album {
  id: string
  title: string
  cover: string
  photos: Array<{
    id: string
    title: string
    url: string
  }>
}
```

<ResponseField name="albums" type="Album[]" required>
  Array of album objects to display.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the album.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].title" type="string" required>
  Album title displayed on the album card.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].cover" type="string" required>
  URL to the album cover image.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].photos" type="Photo[]" required>
  Array of photos in the album.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].photos[].id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the photo.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].photos[].title" type="string" required>
  Photo title or caption.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="albums[].photos[].url" type="string" required>
  URL to the full-resolution photo.
</ResponseField>

## Display Modes

The Albums resource has two display modes:

### Inline Mode (Default)

Displays albums in a horizontal scrolling carousel with album cards showing the cover image and photo count.

### Fullscreen Mode

When a user selects an album, the resource:
1. Sets the selected album ID in widget state using `useWidgetState()`.
2. Requests fullscreen mode via `useWidgetAPI()`.
3. Displays a fullscreen photo viewer with:
   - Film strip navigation (desktop only).
   - Large centered photo display.
   - Automatic selection reset when switching albums.

## State Management

The resource uses `useWidgetState` to persist the selected album across sessions:

```tsx
interface AlbumsState {
  selectedAlbumId?: string | null
}
```

## Features

### Safe Area Support

Respects device safe areas using `useSafeArea()` to ensure proper padding on devices with notches or rounded corners.

### Height Constraints

Uses `useMaxHeight()` to adapt to available screen space and prevent overflow.

## Common Use Cases

- Photo gallery applications
- Portfolio viewers
- Image collection browsing
- Media library interfaces
