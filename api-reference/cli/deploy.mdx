description: "Deploy resources to production with the 'prod' tag."

## Overview

The `sunpeak deploy` command is a convenience wrapper around `sunpeak push` that automatically applies the `prod` tag to your resources. This is the recommended way to deploy to production.

```bash
sunpeak deploy [directory] [options]
```

<Info>
`sunpeak deploy` is equivalent to `sunpeak push --tag prod`
</Info>

<Warning>
You must be logged in to use this command. Run `sunpeak login` first.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before deploying:

1. **Login** - Run `sunpeak login` to authenticate
2. **Build** - Run `sunpeak build` to create production bundles

## How It Works

The deploy command:

1. Finds all resource folders in `dist/` (e.g., `dist/albums/`, `dist/carousel/`)
2. Uploads each resource bundle and its simulations to the Sunpeak repository
3. Assigns the `prod` tag (or a custom tag if specified)

```bash
$ sunpeak deploy
Deploying to production...

Pushing 2 resource(s) to repository "myorg/my-app"...
Tag: prod

✓ Pushed search (id: abc123)
  Tags: prod
✓ Pushed dashboard (id: def456)
  Tags: prod

✓ Successfully pushed 2 resource(s).
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `directory` | Optional resource directory to deploy (e.g., `dist/carousel`). If not provided, deploys all resources from `dist/` |

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--repository <owner/repo>` | `-r` | Repository name (defaults to git remote origin) |
| `--tag <name>` | `-t` | Override the tag (defaults to `prod`) |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message |

## Usage Examples

### Deploy All Resources

```bash
sunpeak deploy
```

### Deploy a Single Resource

```bash
sunpeak deploy dist/carousel
```

### Deploy with Custom Tag

If you need a different production tag:

```bash
sunpeak deploy --tag production
```

### Deploy to Specific Repository

```bash
sunpeak deploy --repository myorg/my-app
```

## Typical Workflow

A standard deployment workflow:

```bash
# 1. Build production bundles
sunpeak build

# 2. Deploy to production
sunpeak deploy
```

Or as a single command:

```bash
sunpeak build && sunpeak deploy
```

<Tip>
Add this to your `package.json` scripts for convenience:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "sunpeak build && sunpeak deploy"
  }
}
```
</Tip>

## Deploy vs Push

| Command | Default Tag | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `sunpeak deploy` | `prod` | Production deployments |
| `sunpeak push` | None | Staging, versioning, or custom workflows |

Use `sunpeak deploy` when you want to deploy to production with a simple command. Use `sunpeak push` when you need more control over tagging or want to push to non-production environments.
