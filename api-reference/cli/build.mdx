description: "Build optimized production bundles for deployment."

## Overview

The `sunpeak build` command creates optimized, production-ready JavaScript bundles for your MCP Resources. Each Resource file is built as a separate, standalone bundle.

```bash
sunpeak build
```

<Info>
In a sunpeak project, run this command via your package manager: `pnpm build`, `npm run build`, or `yarn build`.
</Info>

## Output

The build process creates:

- **Minified JavaScript** - Optimized and compressed for minimal file size
- **CSS extraction** - Unused Tailwind styles removed automatically
- **Asset optimization** - Static assets with hashed filenames for caching
- **Source maps** - For debugging production issues

### Output Directory

```
dist/
└── chatgpt/
    ├── example.js
    ├── example.css
    └── assets/
        └── [hashed-files]
```

Each MCP Resource from `src/components/resources/*-resource.tsx` is built to `dist/chatgpt/[name].js`.

## Automatic Discovery

The build automatically discovers and builds all files matching the pattern:

```
src/components/resources/*-resource.tsx
```

For example:
- `search-resource.tsx` → `dist/chatgpt/search.js`
- `calendar-resource.tsx` → `dist/chatgpt/calendar.js`
- `dashboard-resource.tsx` → `dist/chatgpt/dashboard.js`

<Note>
No entry point configuration needed! The framework handles discovery automatically.
</Note>

## Build Optimizations

### Tree Shaking

Unused code is automatically removed from the bundle:

```tsx
// Only the imported components are included in the bundle
import { Card, Button } from 'sunpeak';
```

### Code Splitting

Each Resource is built as a separate bundle:

- Reduces initial load time
- Allows independent updates
- Improves caching

### CSS Purging

Tailwind CSS automatically removes unused utility classes:

- Only classes actually used in your components are included
- Significantly reduces CSS file size
- No manual configuration required

## Usage

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Options

### Custom Output Directory

By default, bundles are output to `dist/chatgpt/`. To customize this, you can configure Vite in your project.

### Build Mode

The build runs in production mode by default, with optimizations enabled. For debugging production builds, use:

```bash
sunpeak build --sourcemap
```

## Deployment

After building, deploy the `dist/chatgpt/` directory to any static hosting service:
