title: "sunpeak login"
description: "Authenticate with Sunpeak to push and pull resources."

## Overview

The `sunpeak login` command authenticates you with your Sunpeak account using a secure browser-based flow. This is required before using `sunpeak push`, `sunpeak pull`, or `sunpeak deploy`.

```bash
sunpeak login
```

## How It Works

The login command uses the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization flow:

1. Opens your browser to the Sunpeak authentication page
2. Displays a code if the browser doesn't open automatically
3. Waits for you to complete authentication in the browser
4. Securely stores your credentials locally

```bash
$ sunpeak login
Starting device authorization flow...

Opening browser for authentication...

If the browser didn't open, visit: https://app.sunpeak.ai/oauth/device
And enter code: ABCD-1234

Waiting for authorization...

✓ Successfully logged in to Sunpeak!
```

## Credential Storage

Credentials are stored securely in your home directory:

```
~/.sunpeak/credentials.json
```

The file is created with restricted permissions (readable only by you).

## Session Management

- Credentials persist between terminal sessions
- Run `sunpeak logout` to clear stored credentials
- If already logged in, the command will notify you

```bash
$ sunpeak login
Already logged in. Run "sunpeak logout" first to switch accounts.
```

## Usage

```bash
sunpeak login
```

<Note>
No additional options are required. The command handles the entire authentication flow automatically.
