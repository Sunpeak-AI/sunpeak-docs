## Overview

The `sunpeak push` command uploads your built MCP Resources to the Sunpeak repository, making them available for deployment and version management.

```bash
sunpeak push [directory] [options]
```

<Warning>
You must be logged in to use this command. Run `sunpeak login` first.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before pushing:

1. **Login** - Run `sunpeak login` to authenticate
2. **Build** - Run `sunpeak build` to create production bundles

## How It Works

The push command:

1. Finds all resource folders in `dist/` (e.g., `dist/albums/`, `dist/carousel/`)
2. Reads metadata from each resource's JSON file (name, title, description, mimeType)
3. Uploads each resource bundle and its simulations to the Sunpeak repository
4. Optionally assigns a tag for version management

<Info>
**Resource names must be unique within a repository.** If you push a resource with a name that already exists, it will update the existing resource. The resource name is the `name` field in your `.json` file.
</Info>

```bash
$ sunpeak push
Pushing 2 resource(s) to repository "myorg/my-app"...

✓ Pushed search (id: abc123)
✓ Pushed dashboard (id: def456)

✓ Successfully pushed 2 resource(s).
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `directory` | Optional resource directory to push (e.g., `dist/carousel`). If not provided, pushes all resources from `dist/` |

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--repository <owner/repo>` | `-r` | Repository name (defaults to git remote origin) |
| `--tag <name>` | `-t` | Tag to assign to pushed resources (can be specified multiple times) |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message |

## Usage Examples

### Push All Resources

Push all resources from the `dist/` directory:

```bash
sunpeak push
```

### Push a Single Resource

Push a specific resource directory:

```bash
sunpeak push dist/carousel
```

### Push with Tag

Tag resources for versioning or environment management:

```bash
sunpeak push --tag v1.0.0
```

```bash
sunpeak push --tag staging
```

### Push with Multiple Tags

Apply multiple tags in a single push:

```bash
sunpeak push --tag v1.0.0 --tag latest
```

### Specify Repository

Override the repository name (useful for CI/CD or monorepos):

```bash
sunpeak push --repository myorg/my-app
```

### Combined Options

```bash
sunpeak push -r myorg/my-app -t staging
```

## Repository Detection

By default, the repository name is detected from your git remote:

```bash
# Detected from git remote origin URL:
# - https://github.com/myorg/my-app.git → myorg/my-app
# - git@github.com:myorg/my-app.git → myorg/my-app
```

If no git remote is found, you must specify the repository explicitly with `--repository`.

## Resource Discovery

The command discovers resources by finding all resource folders in the dist directory:

```
dist/
├── search/
│   ├── search.js                    # Resource bundle
│   ├── search.json                  # Metadata
│   └── search-show-simulation.json  # Simulation (optional)
├── dashboard/
│   ├── dashboard.js
│   ├── dashboard.json
│   └── dashboard-{scenario}-simulation.json
```

Each resource folder needs a `.js` bundle and a `.json` metadata file containing name, title, description, and uri. URIs are generated during `sunpeak build`—if a resource is missing its URI, push will fail with an error. Simulation files are automatically included when pushing.
