## Style Guide

Less is more, aim for brevity and clarity. Include simple examples, but only in places where an example makes a subject significantly clearer.

End sentences, descriptions, comments, etc. with a period, except where ending with a colon.

For icons on links, use the link icon for external resources, the page icon for a
page on the documentation tab, and the code icon for a page on the API Reference tab.

Keep page names and file names in sync.

Follow the same general styles and page structures as other pages in the same group.
