## Overview

The sunpeak CLI provides commands for managing ChatGPT Apps.
It includes a client for the [sunpeak Resource Repository](https://app.sunpeak.ai/)
(ECR for ChatGPT Apps).

The repository helps you & your CI/CD decouple your App from your client-agnostic MCP server:

  Tag your app builds with version numbers and environment names (like `v1.0.0` and `prod`).
</Card>

<Card horizontal title="Centralized Storage" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
  `push` built Apps to a central location accessible by your team and CI/CD pipelines.
</Card>

<Card horizontal title="Flexible Deployment" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
  `pull` built Apps to be run in different environments (staging, production, etc.).
</Card>

## Commands

The CLI includes commands for both local development and repository operations:

### Local Development

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sunpeak new` | Create a new sunpeak project |
| `sunpeak dev` | Start the development server (includes simulator and MCP server) |
| `sunpeak build` | Build production bundles |

### Repository Operations

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sunpeak login` | Authenticate with your Sunpeak account |
| `sunpeak logout` | Log out and clear stored credentials |
| `sunpeak push` | Push built resources to the repository |
| `sunpeak pull` | Pull resources by tag from the repository |
| `sunpeak deploy` | Deploy resources to production |

<Note>
The CLI is included when you install sunpeak. No separate installation required!
</Note>

## Why decouple Apps & MCP servers?
ChatGPT Apps are built on MCP servers, but your UI resources don't need to live alongside your server code. Decoupling them provides:

1. **Generic MCP servers**: Keep your production MCP server largely client agnostic
2. **Remove JavaScript**: If your server is in Python (or any other language), keep React and JavaScript out of your server.
3. **Independent lifecycles**: Clearly indicate which code changes and version tags require ChatGPT App submission reviews and which are entirely MCP server-side
4. **Team collaboration**: Designers and frontend devs can push UI changes without touching server infrastructure and vice versa
