## What is sunpeak?

sunpeak is a framework for ChatGPT Apps. With sunpeak, you can quickly build and ship OpenAI ChatGPT Apps, all from your local machine.

sunpeak consists of a library, a framework, and a CLI.

Note that each sunpeak component can be used in isolation if preferred, though the most seamless experience combines all 3.

### The sunpeak Library

An npm package for running & testing ChatGPT Apps. This standalone library contains:

- **[Runtime APIs](/library/runtime-apis)** - Strongly typed, multi-platform APIs for interacting with the ChatGPT runtime, architected to support future platforms (Gemini, Claude).
- **[ChatGPT Simulator](/library/chatgpt-simulator)** - React component replicating ChatGPT's runtime.
  - Testing utilities to automatically test your app in all platform states (theme, displayMode, saved states, etc.)
- **[MCP Server](/library/mcp-server)** - Mock data MCP server for testing local Resources in the real ChatGPT.

### The sunpeak Framework

Next.js for ChatGPT Apps. This templated npm package includes:

- **[Project Scaffold](/template/project-scaffold)** - Complete development setup with build, test, and mcp tooling, including the sunpeak library.
  - **Convention Over Configuration** - Create UIs (resources) by simply creating a `resources/{name}/` folder with `{name}-resource.tsx` and `{name}-resource.json` files.
- **[UI Components](/template/ui-components)** - Production-ready components following ChatGPT design guidelines and using OpenAI apps-sdk-ui React components.

### The sunpeak CLI

Commands for managing ChatGPT Apps. Includes a client for the
[sunpeak Resource Repository](https://app.sunpeak.ai/)
(ECR for ChatGPT Apps). The repository helps you & your CI/CD decouple your App from your client-agnostic MCP server:

- **Version Tagging** - Tag your app builds with version numbers and environment names (like `v1.0.0` and `prod`).
- **Push** - Push built Apps to a central location.
- **Pull** - Pull built Apps to be run in different environments.

## Quick Example

Build and run beautiful ChatGPT App UIs with just a few lines of code:
