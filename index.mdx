## What is sunpeak?

sunpeak is an SDK for MCP Apps. With sunpeak, you can quickly build and ship OpenAI ChatGPT Apps, all from your local machine.

sunpeak consists of two main parts: a library and a starter kit.

### The sunpeak Library

A React npm package (`sunpeak`) for running & testing MCP Apps:

- **Runtime APIs** - Strongly typed multi-platform APIs for interacting with ChatGPT, architected to support future genAI offerings (Gemini, Claude, etc.).
- **Local Testing** - Create simulations in the ChatGPT Simulator to test your UIs locally—manually or automatically.
- **Platform Testing** - Run your simulations in the real ChatGPT using a pre-packaged MCP server.

The sunpeak library can be used for any MCP App project, not just those built with the starter kit.

### The sunpeak Starter Kit

An MCP App starter kit (`pnpm dlx sunpeak new`) that includes:

- **Complete Setup** - Build tools, testing framework, and development environment.
- **UI Components** - Production-ready components following ChatGPT design guidelines, built on OpenAI's apps-sdk-ui.

## Quick Example
