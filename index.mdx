## What is sunpeak?

sunpeak is an SDK for MCP Apps. With sunpeak, you can quickly build and ship OpenAI ChatGPT Apps, all from your local machine.

sunpeak consists of a library and a framework.

### The sunpeak Library

A React npm package (`sunpeak`) for running & testing MCP Apps:

- **Runtime APIs** - Strongly typed multi-platform APIs for interacting with ChatGPT, architected to support future genAI offerings (Gemini, Claude, etc.).
- **Local Testing** - Create simulations in the ChatGPT Simulator to test your UIs locally—manually or automatically.
- **Platform Testing** - Run your simulations in the real ChatGPT using a pre-packaged MCP server.

The sunpeak library can be used for any MCP App project, not just those built with the framework.

### The sunpeak Framework

An MCP App framework (`pnpm dlx sunpeak new`) that includes:

- **Minimal Setup** - Just your app code with framework conventions handling the rest.
- **UI Components** - Production-ready components following ChatGPT design guidelines, built on OpenAI's apps-sdk-ui.
- **CLI Utility** - Command-line utilities for using the framework.

## Quick Example
