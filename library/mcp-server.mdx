## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server lets you serve your widgets to ChatGPT. Once your MCP server is running, ChatGPT can discover and render your widgets.

sunpeak includes an MCP server implementation that lets your render your App out-of-the-box.

## What is MCP?

MCP is the protocol ChatGPT uses to communicate with widget servers. It handles:

- Widget registration and discovery
- Runtime API communication
- Tool invocation and state synchronization

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your app">
    Build your app first.

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
    <Warning>
      You must rebuild you application for later changes to take effect.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the MCP server">
    Start the MCP server on port 6766:

    ```bash
    pnpm mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a tunnel">
    In another terminal, run a tunnel to expose your local server:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 6766
    ```

    Copy the forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to ChatGPT">
    Open ChatGPT **in developer mode** and connect your app:

    1. Go to `User > Settings > Apps & Connectors > Create`
    2. Enter your tunnel URL with the `/mcp` path: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/mcp`
    3. Complete the connection flow
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your widget">
    Send `show app` to ChatGPT to see your widget in action!

    <Warning>
      ChatGPT caches UIs aggressively. Your changes usually require you to **Refresh** your app from the same settings modal as the previous step.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
